* Fix idempodency when setting BosConfig.new
* Run fs wscell to verify openafs.ko is loaded and the cell name is correct
* Ansible logging of retries is unhelpful (e.g. when creating root.afs)
  - Use a shell wrapper to log pts/vos commands on the remote?
  - Is it possilbe to use ansible callbacks to improve logging?
* Use akeyconvert instead of asetkey with hacks to lookup kvnos
